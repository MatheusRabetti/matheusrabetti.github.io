> "Generating numbers is easy, generating numbers you should trust is hard!" 

A highly skilled Data Scientist with 10 years of experience, specializing in complex experimentation, causal inference and probability time series forecasting. My objective is to conduct analyses and build models that prioritize interpretability and clarity over pure performance. By focusing on transparency, I ensure that the insights derived are easily understood, allowing stakeholders to grasp how different actions impact outcomes. This approach enhances decision-making by providing actionable insights, fostering trust in the results, and driving more strategic and informed business decisions. 

I have excelled in a variety of impactful roles across sectors, including serving as a Research Assistant at a Brazilian National Research Institute, Statistician at the Ministry of Labor, Product Analyst at Globo (the largest media company in Latin America), Marketing Scientist at Uber, and Marketing Data Scientist at Glovo, Consultant at Toptal, Lead Product Analyst & Experimentation Ambassador at Vista and Senior Data Scientist for different areas of my current company, Preply.

One of my key strengths is my versatility. I have proven myself in multiple areas of business, from marketing to supply, product, pricing and sales allowing me to develop a broad understanding of diverse business functions. This cross-functional expertise enables me to see the bigger picture and drive results across various domains.

Throughout my career, I have delivered measurable business value through optimal decision-making and effective stakeholder management. My approach balances quick, heuristic insights with rigorous analysis to drive MVP experimentation and informed decision-making. I am driven by intellectual curiosity, a passion for solving complex problems, and a deep commitment to continuous learning and growth.

Experience
============

#### @Preply

* App Core Product Team
    * Implement and QA event taxonomies for self-service analysis on customer and user behaviour.
    * Develop and maintain KPIs and dashboards to monitor product metrics and identify insights.
* Ranking & Pricing
    * Creating price elasticity curves for different marketplace segmentations using Conditional Average Treatment Effect modeling which found a group of segments summing up to 28% of the user base that would generate incremental revenue if the price of their tutors increased by a certain amount.
* Supply & Demand
    * Tutor demand forecast
    * Causal Inference Model - Training impact on Tutor Performance which lead us to shift the strategy from proposing the tutors to take a certain course right after the profile creation approval to 14 days later resulting in 3% incremental revenue.
    * Tutor Community Message Classification (NLP) to track the sentiment of the messages and flagging the critical ones to be addressed by the internal team.
    * Retention Experimentation Framework using Survival Analysis
* B2B Sales & Marketing
    * Lead Scoring Model
    * Hours Utilization Impact on Client Retention. Important for defining the new OKRs for sales agents.
    * Improved B2B users experience by tutor selection. What makes a tutor a good tutor for the specific B2B users needs. Collaboration with user research team.

#### @Vista

* Technical leader of the analytics team for Next Best Action - working on personalised email experience
* Building the experimentation culture, create standardisation and supporting experiment creation and analysis.
* Leading a Data Product team of 3 analysts. Coaching and managing their carreer.
* Implemented Bayesian Experimentation Framework

[Experimentation Culture Awards 2022 - Building a culture of experimentation in public](https://experimentationcultureawards.com/#nominees2022:~:text=WINNER%20of%20the%202022%20Team%20AWARD%20is%3A%20Vista%20(US))

#### @Toptal

* Strategic advisor for Toptal business functions and leaders 
* Leading Talent Operations analytical function.
* Holding weekly analysis prioritization meetings
* Holding monthly business performance review meetings 
* OKRs definition
* Improved newcomers talents retention by 5% in the network and by 2% the talents allocated to a job within 10 days. Discovery 
    * Discovery - discovered talent retention issue. The metric wasn't being tracked. 
    * Problem Statement - explored the data and found that many talents leave the network after finishing a job. 
    * Action Item - Implement a new job matching process to tackle jobs with end scheduled.
* Probability to convert based on Technical Steps Grade - Regression Model to predict when a talent score high in the first steps of the funnel if we can skip further steps in the screening process. 

#### @Glovo

* Experimentation/Causality POC
* Identifying heterogeneous treatment effects of marketing interventions (Retargeting). Segment Discovery leads to more efficient retargeting audiences.
* Multi-Touch Attribution (building the role pipeline for u-shaped and Markov chains)
* UMAP embedding clustering to identify users that churned due to bad user experience.
* Marketing First Order Prediction - predicting total conversions for a specific time window.
* Incrementality Tests for Retargeting and Acquisition
* Build reliable, precise and faster A/B tests with variance reduction (CUPED), bias correction (CUPED / Diff and Diff), identifying novelty or primacy effects, randomization unit correction (Linear Mixed Model), and Bayesian Inference.
* Moving the company culture of decision making based on correlation studies to causality analysis (instrumental variables, propensity score matching, mediation modeling, regression discontinuity, causal diagrams, and others causal inference methods)

#### @Uber 

* Methods for geo experimentation: Bayesian Hierarchical Time Series (Causal Impact), Synthetic Control, Matching Similar Cities and Regions for geo experimentation
* Market Saturation, Total Addressable Market and Opportunity Size for Engagement, Churn and Acquisition segments
